# AdvancedFlexiMergsort

This Python program provides an advanced implementation of the merge sort algorithm, allowing users to choose the number of splits (k) for a more customized sorting approach.

# Overview

The program consists of two main functions:

mergeSort(list_of_items, split_by_k=2):

Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.

# Parameters:

list_of_items: The list of items to be sorted.
split_by_k: An optional parameter indicating the number of splits. Default is 2.
Returns a tuple containing the sorted list and the elapsed time for execution.
merge(left_list, right_list):

Implementation of the merge step in the merge sort algorithm.

This program allows for a more versatile use of the merge sort algorithm, providing users with flexibility in defining the number of splits.
